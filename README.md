## 🤔 How can I add her?
If you want to use BlueBall on your server, you can add our public instance by [clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=465855877623054336&permissions=8&scope=bot)! We recommend using the public instance, after all, my guilds already use, trust and love his, so why not try it out?

You can also host BlueBall yourself, however we won't give support for people that are trying to selfhost her, we don't want to spend hours trying to troubleshoot other people issues that only happens on selfhosted instances, so you should at least know how to troubleshoot issues, if you find any.

## ⏳ How can he is online 24 hours per day?

First of all, it wasn't something that simple to think about, I created this whole application and uploaded it to Replit so I could have it online in a cloud.

After that I put it in Looping through the site [UpTimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), because every 15 seconds the UpTime pings a signal in the application in Replit, not allowing it to turn off automatically, creating an infinite Looping and keeping the application open for free.
